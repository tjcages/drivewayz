    Payment
    You understand that the request or use of the Service may result in charges to you consisting of the rental fee, service fees, and other applicable fees and taxes (“Charges”). Charges applicable may change at any time. Any changes in price will not affect the price of Parking Spaces already reserved by a User. Despite DriveWayz’s best efforts, some of the Parking Spaces listed on the Service may be incorrectly priced. The correct payment amount is the amount shown in the My Bookings page on your account. DriveWayz does not guarantee that pricing for Reservations will be the best available at the time of Reservation or Reservation request.
    
    Charges are determined up front, before you confirm your Reservation. The Charges include the base rate, service fees, and taxes. DriveWayz determines the base rate of a Parking Space, which is subject to surge pricing and may change based on geographic location and demand. DriveWayz fees and taxes are calculated and set in direct relation to the base rate and geographic location of the Parking Space. DriveWayz service fees are subject to change at any time and will be reflected in our Booking Fee Schedule. You acknowledge and agree that Charges applicable in certain geographical areas may increase substantially during times of high demand. DriveWayz will use reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that may apply, provided that you will be responsible for Charges incurred under your Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof. You agree to pay in full the price displayed on the Service for the total reservation price, which includes the parking rate plus, where applicable, service fees, and taxes at the time of your booking request. Once your booking has been successfully completed, a Reservation will be issued in respect of the Parking Space booked. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by DriveWayz.
    
    All financial transactions within the DriveWayz Service are processed by Stripe and its affiliates.
    Terms Specific for Consumers
    You understand that a confirmed Reservation of a Parking Space is a limited license granted to you by the Host to enter, occupy and use the Parking Space for the duration of your Reservation, during which time the Host (only where and to the extent permitted by applicable law) retains the right to enter the Parking Space, in accordance with your agreement with the Host.
    
    You agree to leave the Parking Space no later than the departure time that the Host specifies in the Listing or such other time as mutually agreed upon between you and the Host. If you stay past the agreed upon departure time without the Host's consent (“Overstay”), you no longer have a license to stay in the Parking Space. In the event of an Overstay, you agree to pay for each fifteen (15) minute period (or any portion thereof) that you Overstay at a rate of two (2) times the average hourly Charges of your Reservation, plus all applicable fees, Taxes, and any legal expenses incurred by the Host to make you leave (collectively, "Overstay Fees"). After any Overstay exceeds one (1) hour, DriveWayz will contact the Host who, at the Host’s sole discretion, may request the removal of your vehicle or request the installation of a vehicle immobilization device on your vehicle. All expenses associated with towing and storage of an Overstay vehicle will be charged to your account, neither DriveWayz nor the Host is responsible for any expenses, damages, inconveniences, or costs associated with the towing and/or storage of an Overstay vehicle. If you Overstay at a Parking Space, you authorize DriveWayz to charge you to collect Overstay Fees.
    Terms Specific for Hosts
    If you choose to use DriveWayz as a Host, your relationship with DriveWayz is limited to being an independent, third-party contractor, and not an employee, agent, joint venturer or partner of DriveWayz for any reason, and you act exclusively on your own behalf and for your own benefit, and not on behalf, or for the benefit, of DriveWayz. DriveWayz does not, and shall not be deemed to, direct or control you generally or in your performance under these Terms specifically, including in connection with your provision of the Host Services. You acknowledge and agree that you have complete discretion whether to list Host Services or otherwise engage in other business or employment activities.
    
    When creating and publishing the availability of a Parking Space (“Listing”) through DriveWayz you must (i) provide complete and accurate information about your Host Service (such as Listing description, location, and calendar availability), (ii) disclose any deficiencies, limitations, or restrictions (such as vehicle size limitations and handicap accessibility/exclusivity) and (iii) provide any other pertinent information requested by DriveWayz. You are responsible for keeping your Listing information (including calendar availability) up to date at all times.
    
    DriveWayz recommends that Hosts obtain appropriate insurance for their Host Services. Please review any respective insurance policy carefully, and in particular make sure that you are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of Consumers while parking in your Parking Spaces.
    
    You represent and warrant that any Listing you post and the Reservation of, or a Consumer's use of, a Parking Space will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties, such as homeowners association, condominium, landlords, or other agreements, and that the Listing will not violate any applicable laws, regulations, or other rules applicable to the Parking Space. As a Host, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who park at or are otherwise present at the Parking Space at your request or invitation, excluding the Consumer and any individuals the Consumer invites to the Parking Space.
    Reservation Modifications
    Hosts and Consumers are responsible for any modifications to a Reservation that they make via the Application or direct DriveWayz customer service to make ("Reservation Modifications") and agree to pay any additional Charges and/or Taxes associated with such Reservation Modifications.
    
    Cancellations
    
    Consumers may cancel a confirmed Reservation at any time up to twenty-four (24) hours prior to the start time of a Reservation, and DriveWayz will refund the amount of the Charges according to DriveWayz’s refund policy below.
    
    Hosts may cancel confirmed Reservations in the event of an unexpected circumstance that is out of the Host’s control “Emergency”. An Emergency may include, but is not limited to:
    
    •    Death
    •    Severe illness
    •    Severe damage to the Parking Space that makes it unsafe to host Consumers or makes the Parking Space inaccessible
    •    Road closures that make it impossible to access the Parking Space.
    DriveWayz has sole discretion to determine whether an event or situation is an Emergency for purposes of these Terms.
    
    In certain circumstances, DriveWayz may decide, in its sole discretion, that it is necessary to cancel a pending or confirmed Reservation and initiate corresponding refunds and payouts. This may be (i) where DriveWayz believes in good faith, while taking the legitimate interests of both parties into account, this is necessary to avoid significant harm to DriveWayz, Hosts, Consumers, third parties, or property (ii) in the event that the Host has an Emergency or (iii) in the event the Services experience a technical or administrative issue of any kind.
    
    DriveWayz is not responsible for any inconvenience or loss of income arising from a cancellation.
    Refunds
    In the event a Consumer cancels a confirmed Reservation up to twenty-four (24) hours prior to the start time of a Reservation, DriveWayz will refund the amount to the Consumer as long as the cancelled Reservation has Charges totaling at least $5.00. Any refund provided by DriveWayz that is not related to a Deficiency will result in a $5.00 administration fee charged to the Consumer’s account.
    
    The Reservation is non-refundable if the cancellation is made within twenty-four (24) hours of the start time of a Reservation unless the Consumer properly claims a Deficiency.
    
    In the event a Consumer claims any of the following situations (“Deficiency”), DriveWayz may approve a full refund to the Consumer:
    
    1.    the Host of the Parking Space (i) cancels a Reservation before the scheduled start of the Reservation, or (ii) fails to provide the Consumer with the reasonable ability to access the Parking Space (e.g. does not provide a security code).
    2.    the Listing’s description or depiction is materially inaccurate with respect to (i) the physical location of the Parking Space or (ii) any restrictions of the Parking Space (such as vehicle size limitations and handicap accessibility/exclusivity).
    3.    at the start of the Reservation time, the Parking Space is occupied by another vehicle.
    4.    the Parking Space does not exist.
    To submit a valid claim for a Deficiency and receive a refund for your Reservation, you are required to meet each of the following conditions:
    
    1.    you must be the Consumer that booked the Parking Space;
    2.    you must bring the Deficiency to our attention in writing or via telephone and provide us with required information including (i) photographs of the Parking Space (or alleged location of the Parking Space if it is nonexistent) and (ii) an explanation of the issue within 24 hours after the later of (i) the start of your Reservation or (ii) you discover the existence of the Deficiency;
    3.    you must respond to any requests by us for additional information or cooperation on the Deficiency;
    4.    you must not have directly or indirectly caused the Deficiency (through your action, omission or negligence).
    
    For any Deficiency that results in a Consumer’s inability to complete a Reservation, DriveWayz will direct the Consumer to the next closest spot and provide a discount on the Consumer’s next Reservation completed within twelve (12) hours of start time of the original Reservation.
    Governing Laws
