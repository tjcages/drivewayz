In response to a User’s online request for a reservation through the DriveWayz Application, User communicates directly with the applicable individual holding/operating said space (the Host of the Listing) regarding said reservation request. The availability of reservations is determined at the time of the User’s query, and DriveWayz makes no representation or warranty (i) regarding the accuracy of any date (including, but not limited to, reservation availability data) received from any Host. Each Host is an independent third party and is not under the control of DriveWayz. DriveWayz is not a guarantor, agent, or otherwise affiliated with any Host. You acknowledge that each Host may have its own policies, terms, and conditions. Once a reservation request is made by a User through the DriveWayz Application, the Host with such space will provide confirmation of the Reservation to such User by pre-authorizing the Services to auto accept all reservation requests within specified hours and specified days, or by manual approval at the time of request. By using the Reservation Services, you agree to receive reservation confirmations by DriveWayz messaging after requesting a Reservation Service.

    THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMERS APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. YOU MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, THE DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
    
    33.    Release. Hosts are solely responsible for their interactions with you and any and all claims, injuries, illnesses, damages, liabilities and costs (“Claims”) suffered by you or any third party as a result of your interaction with or visit to any Host. YOU HEREBY RELEASE THE DRIVEWAYZ  PARTIES FROM ANY AND ALL SUCH CLAIMS. IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOREGOING, YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY CIVIL CODE WHICH STATES DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.” You hereby expressly waive and relinquish all rights and benefits under this section and any law of any jurisdiction of similar effect with respect to the release of any unknown or unsuspected claims you may have against the DriveWayz Parties pertaining to the subject matter of this Section 32.
    34.    Severability. If any part of this Terms & Conditions is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and Agreement shall continue in effect
    35.    Assignment. This Terms & Conditions, and the rights granted and obligations undertaken hereunder, may not be transferred, assigned or delegated in any manner by a User, but may be freely transferred, assigned, or delegated by DriveWayz.
    36.    Waiver. Any waiver of any provision of this Terms & Conditions, or a delay by any party in the enforcement of any right hereunder, shall neither be construed as a continuing waiver nor create an expectation of non-enforcement of that or any other provision or right.
    37.    Arbitration and Venue. Any and all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action (including the interpretation and scope of this clause) between you and the DriveWayz Parties or their successors or assigns shall exclusively be settled through binding and confidential arbitration in Boulder County, Colorado.
    
    Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law. The arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator, certified by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes. As modified by this Terms & Conditions, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the “Rules and Procedures”).
    
    You and DriveWayz must abide by the following rules: (a) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR DRIVEWAYZ MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE {'PARTY\'S'} INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (b) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (c) the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (d) the arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; (e) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law; and (f) each side pays its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses, and, in such instance, the fees and costs awarded shall be determined by the applicable law.
    
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or DriveWayz may bring an individual action in small claims court. Further, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration agreement. Such claims shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in Boulder County, Colorado. Additionally, notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before the state or federal courts located in Boulder County, Colorado, in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and hereby agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Boulder County, Colorado, for such purpose. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.
    
    With the exception of subparts (a) and (b) in this Section (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting part was not contained herein. If, however, either subpart (a) or (b) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor DriveWayz shall be entitled to arbitration. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute shall be exclusively brought in state or federal court located in Boulder County, Colorado.

    38.    Choice of Law. The Services are operated by a U.S. entity, and this Terms & Conditions is made under and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Colorado, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.
    
    39.    General Terms. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, or employment relationship exists between you and any of the DriveWayz Parties as a result of agreeing to this Terms & Conditions or use of the Services. Further, no joint venture, partnership, or employment relationship exists between any of the DriveWayz Parties and any Host.
